If your (hot) computer is infected by malware it can try to deceive you, but unlike hardware wallets it does not have access to your private keys.
For this reason, it may be reasonable for you to skimp on many of the advanced security/validation steps.

Your computer will run two important pieces of software:
* Bitcoin core node - to interact with (and validate!) the bitcoin blockchain
* Specter-Desktop - to interact with your hardware wallets when verifying receive addresses and signing transactions

For non-advanced users, we recommend buying a [MyNode](https://mynodebtc.com/) as it will be easiest to setup/maintain.
MyNode [comes with Specter-Desktop already pre-installed](https://twitter.com/BitcoinQ_A/status/1280802711399796736), and allows you to skip to the next section ([Setup Hardware Wallets](/setup-wallets)).

Advanced users who have an extra focus on security and/or enjoy customization may prefer to setup their own computer, bitcoin core node, and specter-desktop following these instructions:

[TODO]: auto-gen this TOC somehow?
* [Setup Computer](computer)
* [Run Bitcoin Core Node](bitcoin-node)
* [Install Specter-Desktop](specter)
