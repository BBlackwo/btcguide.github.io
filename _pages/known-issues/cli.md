title: Command Line Usage Required
---

The ultimate goal of this guide is to make multisig possible for technically-minded users, but make everything accessible via normal GUIs and not require useage of the command line.

Unfortunately, the exsiting GUI tools do not support calculating the root fingerprint (needed for multisig) on Paper Wallet generation.
More info [here](../setup-wallets/paper).
