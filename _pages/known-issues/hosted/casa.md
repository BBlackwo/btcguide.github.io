Casa is neat in that they will allow you to signup without showing any government documents or even giving your name.

#### No Cobo Vault Support
This will hopefully change.
This also means that properly verifying a receive address is very complicated.

#### Some Keys Kept on Phone Hot Wallet
Given the nature of multisig (and the size of your quorum) this may be a bad thing (software hot wallets are inherently far less secure) or a good thing (better UX and one less device to buy/configure/update).

#### Sovereign Recovery Not Well Documented
While you can leave their service (or recover your coins if they go out of business), the process is [not straightforward](https://walletsrecovery.org/recovery-docs/casa-recovery.html).
