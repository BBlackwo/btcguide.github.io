#### Limited Hardware Wallet Support
No Coldcard nor Cobo Vault support, although Unchained has publicly committed to adding Coldcard.
This means that (for now) **properly verifying a receive address is only possible for expert users**.

It would be great if Unchained would offer `3-of-5` signature schemes in the future.

#### Sovereign Recovery is Hard
While you can leave their service (or recover your coins if they go out of business), [the process](https://unchained-capital.com/blog/external-spend-workflow/) is only possible for advanced users.
Their use of non-standard BIP32 paths further complicates this process.
