#### Limited Hardware Wallet Support
No Coldcard nor Cobo Vault support, although Unchained has publicly committed to adding Coldcard.
This means that (for now) **properly verifying a receive address is only possible for expert users**.

{% include hosted/2of3.md %}
It would be great if Unchained would offer `3-of-5` signature schemes in the future.

#### Sovereign Recovery Not Well Documented
While you can leave their service (or recover your coins if they go out of business), the process is likely only possible for expert users.
TODO: add link to sovereign recovery (via Caravan?).
Their use of non-standard BIP32 paths further complicates this process.
