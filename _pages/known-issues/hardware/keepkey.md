#### Fork of Trezor
This hardware wallet was launched by forking Trezor's open-source code.
While forking open-source projects is normal in software development, if the forked project is not more actively maintained than the original it is *less* likely to catch bugs and upgrade to support new features.
See [Trezor Known Issues](/known-issues/hardware/trezor) for more info on problems with this device.

#### Only 1 Button
Only 1 button.
This makes it impossible to enter a recovery seed / passphrase on the device.
They do have some clever UX options for you to do this on your host computer [using a substitution cipher](https://keepkey.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001449050-How-Do-I-Recover-on-My-KeepKey-) but it is difficult/confusing and discourages use.
