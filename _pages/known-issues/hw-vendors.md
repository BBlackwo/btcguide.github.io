## Hardware Wallet Vendors

Unfortunately, there are few hardware wallets with good multisig capabilities.

Currently, only 2 hardware wallets (Coldcard & Cobo Vault) even offer BIP174 support.

Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT or [BIP174](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0174.mediawiki)) was proposed in July 2017 and merged into Bitcoin Core [in October 2018](https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.17.0#bip-174-partially-signed-bitcoin-transactions-support).
Wallets that don't update their software could easily become abandonware.

Large transactions can also be [slower to sign](https://blog.keys.casa/bitcoin-multisig-hardware-signing-performance/).
