#### Secure Element (and other Parts) Are Closed Source

#### Built on General Purpose OS (Android)
Some hardware wallets use streamlined operating systems to reduce their attack surface.

#### Supports Many Altcoins
Altcoin support increases the complexity of your codebase and makes it harder to audit/verify what's happening.
While Cobo has a bitcoin-only firmware, this is not a perfect solution.

TODO: add links for both these claims.

#### Mild Annoyances
These are all things that are annoying but not show-stoppers:
* Doesn't support testnet.
For now, the only way to use Cobo is to be #wreckless and do it with real money on mainnet.
While not ideal, if you're buying 2 hardware wallets and spending all the time to set this up, you can probably afford the transaction fees.
The team is working on adding testnet support asap.

* Slow bootup time.
The fingerprint reader does help makeup for this!
* Long PIN can be annoying to enter on keyboard.
However, this only matters when the fingerprint reader fails.
* The microSD card is hard to remove.
A simple pair of tweezers solves the problem.
More importantly, the strong QR-code airgap means you don't have to use the SD card often.
