## Multisig

While multisig offers **unparalleled security** (see more in the [Why Multisig](#why-multisig) section), the benefits do not come for free.

Here are some of the current negatives of using any multisig scheme:

* [Added Complexity](#complexity)
* [Limited Hardware Wallet Support](#hardware-wallet-vendors)
* [Verifying Receive Addresses](#verify-receive-address)
* [Extra Cost](#cost)
* [Seeds and Privacy Leaks](#seeds-and-privacy)
