## Multiple Locations

#### Physical Security
Not only does storing all of your bitcoin information in one place make it less secure, it also makes you a target!
You don't want a home-invader to be able to hold you at gunpoint for your life-savings.
The downside here is that funds kept this way may be a little harder to spend (you have to visit multiple secure locations).
For day-to-day funds, you might choose a simpler single-key signature wallet setup that is faster to spend (but not as secure).

#### Natural Disasters
If you keep all your seeds in one location and there is a fire (or flood) you could lose everything, perhaps when you need it most.
In the unlikely event you need to evacuate, you don't also want to be carrying your life-savings on you (see previous section on physical security).

Imagine you have a 2-of-3 scheme with 1 seed in each of 3 cities (A, B, and C).
Should you need to evacuate city A, you can take seed A with you to city B or to city C.
As you are only carrying 1 (of a needed 2) seeds, should you be robbed during this time your attacker will not be able to spend your bitcoin.
Important note: get to your other 2 seeds ASAP to "rotate" out the key that was stolen by moving your funds to a new multisig scheme where you control all 3 keys.

The negative of course to having your locations too far away is that it will be a pain for you when you want to spend your bitcoin.
Only you can decide what the appropriate balance of these tradeoffs are.

#### Give One (or More) Copies to Someone You Trust
If someone has a quorum of seeds, they can potentially steal your bitcoins!
This may be a good thing (perhaps a spouse) or a bad thing (perhaps a financial manager who might be tempted to steal).
