title: Send Bitcoin
---

In order to send bitcoin, you will need to sign on `2-of-3` of your hardware wallets.

At this point, you should've completed all the previous sections.
Once you've [verified your recieve addresses](/verify-receive-address) and [backed up your wallet](/backup-wallet), it's safe to recieve bitcoin.
Now we'll go over how to spend some of them.

[TODO]: auto-gen this TOC somehow?
