title: Emergency Recovery

By default, you will sign your `2-of-3` transactions on your `2` hardware wallets (Cobo Vault and Coldcard).
If either device is lost or destroyed, you should replace it with a new one and load the corresponding seed backup (from the [Setup Paper Wallet step earlier](/setup-wallets/paper)) onto the replacement device.

However, if for any reason that doesn't work (perhaps there is a bug in their software or a device is no longer available for sale), you can load that BIP39 seed onto another device.
