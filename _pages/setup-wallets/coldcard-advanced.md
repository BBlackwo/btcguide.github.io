#### Avoid Plugging in the Coldcard

Instead of connecting it to your hot machine for power, use a battery pack (or wall outlet) and a 
[charge-only (no-data) USB cable](https://www.amazon.com/PortaPow-Specialised-3-3ft-20AWG-Charge/dp/B00RQ5AZ6Q)
or a
[USB condom](https://www.amazon.com/PortaPow-3rd-Gen-Data-Blocker/dp/B00QRRZ2QM)
on a regular micro-USB cable.
