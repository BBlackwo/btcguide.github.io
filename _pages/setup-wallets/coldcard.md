#### Verify Number on Bag

The Coldcard will come in a bag with a letter or barcode under the number (e.g. C0008091) - when you first start up the device, confirm that it displays this number.
See Matt Odellâ€™s Coldcard video from approx 3 mins in [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sM2uhyROpAQ&feature=youtu.be&t=180).
