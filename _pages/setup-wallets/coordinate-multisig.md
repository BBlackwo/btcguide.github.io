title: Coordinate Multisig
---

Now that we have all your public key information in Specter-Desktop, we need to create your `2-of-3` multisig wallet.
We tell Specter-Desktop and each hardware wallet that these are your 3 public keys and that any 2 of them is sufficient to sign a transaction.
This is a one-time setup that you'll never need to repeat.

## Setup Specter Desktop

1. On Specter Desktop, select `+ Add new wallet` > `Multisignature wallet`

2. Give a name to your wallet (i.e. `Redundant Multisig`), choose `Segwit` (default), `2-of-3` (dfeault) and select your 3 cosigners: `Cobo`, `Coldcard` and `Paper Wallet`

3. Select your public keys. If you've followed the default steps, you'll just select all 3 of them.

4. See your first bitcoin address!:

(we'll learn how to trustlessly verify addresses in the [Verify Receive Address section](/verify-receive-address/))
