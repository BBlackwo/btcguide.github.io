#### Option A - Seedpicker
[http://seedpicker.net/](http://seedpicker.net/)

Since [seedpicker currently requires a CLI script to supplement it](https://github.com/merland/seedpicker/issues/23), so we're using option B exclusively (a CLI script that does everything in one step).

This is included in [Known Issues](../known-issues/cli)

#### Option B - HumanRNG
