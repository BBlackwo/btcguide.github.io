In a perfect world, you’d carefully verify the software you’re installing.
However, since no private key material will ever touch this hot machine\* (and multiple hardware wallets will be required to sign any transactions), it may be acceptable for you to install software that seems correct (without formally verifying it using the command-line).

You’ll want to download and install the latest long term stable (LTS) version of [Ubuntu Desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop), which is currently 20.04.1.
You can download this installer and put it on a USB stick or burn it onto a DVD.
Both options are good, though we find DVDs are slightly preferable as they are slightly more secure and don’t take up a USB port.

See [these step-by-step instructions](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop).


\*While we recommend that no private key material ever touch this machine, that setup is slightly more involved and thus you may choose to have 1 key only touch this machine (and then wipe the machine after).
Remember that this alone is not sufficient to steal/lockup funds, so it may present an acceptable tradeoff, at least for smaller HODLers.
