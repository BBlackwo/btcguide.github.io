#### Tails Operating System
For our one-time offline key generation, it is preferable to use a live operating system that doesn't store data on the file system.
[Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) is a live OS that is designed to wipe itself completely on shutdown.

Follow [these installation instructions](https://tails.boum.org/install/index.en.html) to install Tails for offline use.
