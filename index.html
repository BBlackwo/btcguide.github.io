<h1>10x Security Guide</h1>
<p>How to store bitcoin without a single point of failure</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

INSERT HERE.

<p>
  Multisig security is a difference in kind and not in degree.
  We are used to the idea of something either existing or not existing, and a probablistic framework (say 2-of-3) is not something we are used to.
  The ability to make 1 (or more) catastrophic failures in the security of your bitcoin without suffering loss is extremely valuable.
  In order to do this, our multisig scheme must not contain any single point of failure.
  By using a system that is fundamentally more secure, you can move much faster (with less caution) through any each step and still attain far higher levels of security vs a single-key system, which by design has many single points of failure.
  This guide will show you how.
</p>

<p>
  The ultimate purpose of this guide is to make multisig accessible to a tech-savvy audience who does not write code.
  We will not require use of the command-line.
  <strong>
    Unfortunately, right now there are some bugs/vulnerabilities that do require some command-line skills.
    For users who are not comfortable using the command-line, you are encouraged to wait for a future release.

  Let's get started in demonstrating how the most scarce commodity in human history is now also the most secureable.
