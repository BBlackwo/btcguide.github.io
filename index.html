<h1>10x Security Guide</h1>
<p>
  How to store bitcoin without a single point of failure. By <a href="https://twitter.com/mflaxman">@mflaxman</a>.
</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
  Multisig security is a difference in kind and not in degree.
  The ability to make 1 (or more) catastrophic failures in the security of your bitcoin without suffering loss is extremely valuable.
  In order to do this, our multisig scheme must not contain any single point of failure.
  By using a system that is fundamentally <strong>much</strong> more secure, you can move much faster (with less caution) through each step and still attain far higher levels of security vs any single-key system.
  This guide will show you how.
</p>

<p>
  The ultimate purpose of this guide is to make multisig accessible to a tech-savvy audience who does not write code.
  We will not require use of the command-line.
  <strong>
    Unfortunately, right now there are some bugs/vulnerabilities that do require some command-line experience.
    For users who are not comfortable using the command-line, you are encouraged to wait for a future release.
  </strong>
  You can track progress on known bugs/issues <a href="#">here</a>.
