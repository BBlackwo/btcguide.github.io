Any third party service that can participate/coordinate multisig transactions will have access to your balance and transaction history.
They may be forced to share your records with multiple government agencies, and often be legally unable to disclose compliance with these requests.
Of course most bitcoiners buy their coins on exchanges that follow KYC/AML procedures, so this may or may not be a factor for your use-case.
