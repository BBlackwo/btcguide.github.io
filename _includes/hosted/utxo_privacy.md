Any third party service that can participate/coordinate multisig transactions will have access to your balance and transaction history.
They may be forced to share your records with local government agencies, and even be legally unable to disclose their compliance with these requests.
Worse, local governments may share your records with foreign governments.
Of course most bitcoiners buy their coins on exchanges that follow KYC/AML procedures, so this may or may not be a factor for your use-case.
