#### Alternate Use: U2F Key
This wallet can be converted to a [Universal 2nd Factor (U2F)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor) key for logging into trusted third parties like Twitter, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, DropBox, etc.
While this won't have any direct impact on the security of bitcoin private keys that are under your physical control, it does significantly impair hackers' ability to wreak havoc on your digital life.

If you use this as a U2F key, you should probably use it only for that purpose and not for storing bitcoin.
There are already many reputable U2F hardware providers and their dedicated products are very affordable.
It is not recommended to buy this device for use as a U2F key, but you may be able to salvage some value out of it that way if you upgrade to another device.
