#### Written in Python
This is not inherently a problem (python is a good general-purpose programming language!), but several hardware wallets with varying level of multisig support are also written in python, including: Trezor, Coldcard, KeepKey and Passport.
These hardware wallets share *a lot* of upstream code, and it's possible that if a vulnerability were discovered in one it would be present in the others.
