Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT or [BIP174](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0174.mediawiki)) was proposed in July 2017 and merged into Bitcoin Core [in October 2018](https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.17.0#bip-174-partially-signed-bitcoin-transactions-support).
Wallets that don't update their software could easily become abandonware.
