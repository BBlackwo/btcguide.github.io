### Altcoin-Focused
In theory, supporting altcoins does not fundamentally weaken bitcoin security.
In practice, the more complex a codebase is the more likely a security bug will be introduced (or go undetected).
These wallets are liable to be slow to upgrade their security, and [bit rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot) is more likely to set in.
